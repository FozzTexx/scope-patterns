This is a little Python script I cobbled together to generate signals
for my oscilloscope in the recent BBS decal challenge video I made
(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnLArjNYp-U). Since I didn't find one
ready-made out there, I figured I'd share mine. It outputs random
different frequency sine waves on both the left and right
channels. The original intent was to put my Tektronix 453 into XY
mode, but for whatever reason it refused to work that way. But even
with just the sine waves being displayed it made for a nice looking
prop in the video!
